# Happy Bonsai

Summary: Project that I came up with during my last few days in BrainStation. It is an application that renders 3D objects to track reader progress and allows users to log books and see their list grow. Came up with this idea as I wanted to start reading more this year.

Utilizing the following react libraries/services/APIs:

- Google Books API
- Styled-components
- React-icons
- React-router-dom
- React-three-fiber
- Three.js
- Axios 
- Firebase
