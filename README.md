# Happy Bonsai

Summary: Project that I came up with during my last few days in BrainStation. It is an application that renders 3D objects to track reader progress and allows users to log books and see their list grow. The application uses a Firebase database to authenticate users and store their data in their Realtime Database.

To run application, first clone and then "npm start"
